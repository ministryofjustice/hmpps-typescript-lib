# @ministryofjustice/hmpps-npm-allow-scripts

This package aims to restrict npm scripts from running unless as part of a predefined allowlist

## Status

**This library is currently: Alpha.**
Teams are welcome to trial this library. Please provide feedback via slack to the `#typescript` channel.

## Migrating existing projects

#### Automatically installing the library

The package will self install and initialised by running via npx:
`npx @ministryofjustice/hmpps-npm-allow-scripts`

Note: The project needs to be initialised before use - solely adding the library will make no difference.
Once the project has been initialised, other developers should be able to develop against it without further configuration.
